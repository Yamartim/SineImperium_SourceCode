## Game description:
_A game for the GMTK game jam 2020 of which the theme was "Out Of Control"_

_The original idea was to make a platformer where the character moves randomly and the player would need to manipulate the enviroment to influence the movement, unfortunately we weren't fully able to implement every mechanic we wanted, oops!_

_We hope you enjoy the little sidescroller movement experiment we managed to make in the time we had though! Thanks for playing! :D_
